<h2><a name="sec4">4 Creating new object</a></h2>
<p>The true power of Unlimited Racer is not actually "unlimited racing" but "unlimited editing". If the set of game objects offered by Limited Editor is not satisfying for you, you can add your own object.</p>
<h3><a name="sec4.1">4.1 Importing model</a></h3>
<p>First of all you have to create a new 3D model of some object. You can use any 3D studio for this, but it is important to be able to export your new model into a <strong>.x</strong> file format used by Unlimited Racer. There are several options you have to obtain model in .x format:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your favourite 3D studio is capable of saving (or exporting) models in .x format (not very likely).</li>
	<li>Some plugin exists for your software which is capable of exporting models in .x format (for example <a href="http://www.andytather.co.uk/Panda/directxmax_downloads.aspx">Panda Directx Exporter</a> for 3DS MAX).</li>
	<li>Your software can export models in <strong>.3ds</strong> file format which can be lately transformed into .x format.<li>
</ul>
<p>The latest case is the most common, so we will take a closer look at this one. Suppose you already have a 3d model of a tree. You have to export the model to .3ds file format, so lets say the file name is <strong>tree.3ds</strong>. Now you have to use some external tool to convert it to .x format. You can find some on the Internet, for example: <a href="http://www.mikrogen.kobranet.cz/cz/gifts/conv3ds.zip">Conv3ds</a>, <a href="http://www.righthemisphere.com/products/dexp/">Deep Exploration</a> or <a href="http://download.nafura.it/home/pc/download.asp?IDLink=18890&sps=">EZ Conv3DS</a> which internally uses the first mentioned Conv3ds tool. Deep Exploration is a complex powerful tool which we can strongly recommend, however it's not free. So we will describe the procedure on Conv3ds.</p>
<p>Download <strong>Conv3ds</strong> from the link above so you have a proper version (other versions will probably contain only command line tool). If you start the <strong>shell.exe</strong> program, a window as showed on following image should appear.</p>
<img src="images/Conv3ds.png"/>
<p>First, click on Open button and find the tree.3ds file in the Open dialog. When the file is chosen, you have to specify some parameters. The image above shows the most common configuration. You can change scaling factor though. When creating models in your 3d studio, use generic units and assume 1 unit = 1 cm. If you use different measure, you will have to update the scaling factor here by changing the value 1.0 to fit your needs. Then you can click on Convert button which performs the conversion. A new file <strong>tree.x</strong> should appear in the same location as your .3ds file. With a bit of luck this is what you wanted, so copy this model file into <strong>[UnlimitedRacerInstallPath]\Data\Models\</strong> directory.</p>
<p>Remember, that you can create several models for single game object. Each model can represent the same entity, but in different level of complexity (or detail). Creating more models (up to 10) for single object is a good habit which commonly leads in a better game performance than having just a single complex model. So if you have more models, try to name them tree_1.x, tree_2.x, etc.</p>
<p>Finally you have to copy all textures used on your model into <strong>[UnlimitedRacerInstallPath]\Data\Textures\</strong> directory. Supported image (texture) formats are .png, .tga, .bmp, .jpg and .gif. You can use as many textures as you want on your model, however we highly recommend to use <strong>only 1</strong> image per model, with both height and width of a size of a power of 2 (e.g. 64, 128, 256,...) and as small as possible.</p>

<h3><a name="sec4.2">4.2 Creating model definition</a></h3>
<p>Once you have a valid .x model file (or a set of .x files) placed in proper game folder, you need to create a model definition which can be associated with Limited Editor's game objects. Use Limited Editor to create this file. Click on the button which is marked by number 12 on the first figure of this manual. File edit dialog will appear. Doubleclick on <strong>ALL LODS</strong> item in the right panel and it should fill the lower panel with predefined data. 10 sections describes 10 levels of detail of your new object. Each one can use different model and different texture(s).</p>
<p>Choose the first section (which is LOD0) - level of detail description - and define a 3d model for it. This means you set the <strong>model</strong> property to the name of the .x file (tree_1.x in our case). So the result can be:</p>
<pre>&lt;LOD0&gt;
	model = tree_1.x
	&lt;textures&gt;
	&lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD0&gt;</pre>
<p>The <strong>textures</strong> section can be used to replace texture usage for this specific model. This is most usual when you create one model and have several different textures available for it. Common example is a single car available in different colors. Lets say the original model uses texture tree.png. You want to create a new snow-covered tree and you have a special texture tree_snow.png available. In <strong>textures</strong> section you define these substitutions by adding <strong>OldTexture = NewTexture</strong> lines into it.</p>
	<p>You have to repeat the described procedure 10 times to define all 10 levels of detail. Each level can use different model, so you can bind the most simple model to the LOD0 and the most complex one to LOD9. However, you can still use the same model for all levels of detail if you don't have more models. The result of whole procedure can be following:</p>
<pre>&lt;LOD0&gt;
  model = tree_1.x
  &lt;textures&gt;
    tree.png = tree_snow.png
  &lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD0&gt;
&lt;LOD1&gt;
  model = tree_1.x
  &lt;textures&gt;
    tree.png = tree_snow.png
  &lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD1&gt;
&lt;LOD2&gt;
  model = tree_1.x
  &lt;textures&gt;
    tree.png = tree_snow.png
  &lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD2&gt;
&lt;LOD3&gt;
  model = tree_2.x
  &lt;textures&gt;
    tree.png = tree_snow.png
  &lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD3&gt;
&lt;LOD4&gt;
  model = tree_2.x
  &lt;textures&gt;
    tree.png = tree_snow.png
  &lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD4&gt;
&lt;LOD5&gt;
  model = tree_2.x
  &lt;textures&gt;
    tree.png = tree_snow.png
  &lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD5&gt;
&lt;LOD6&gt;
  model = tree_3.x
  &lt;textures&gt;
    tree.png = tree_snow.png
  &lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD6&gt;
&lt;LOD7&gt;
  model = tree_3.x
  &lt;textures&gt;
    tree.png = tree_snow.png
  &lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD7&gt;
&lt;LOD8&gt;
  model = tree_4.x
  &lt;textures&gt;
    tree.png = tree_snow.png
  &lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD8&gt;
&lt;LOD9&gt;
  model = tree_4.x
  &lt;textures&gt;
    tree.png = tree_snow.png
  &lt;/textures&gt;
&lt;/LOD9&gt;</pre>
<p>The model definition is done, you only have to save it by clicking on Save button and proceed to create a new game object using this model.</p> 
	
<h3><a name="sec4.3">4.3 Creating new game object</a></h3>
<p>Create a new map in Limited Editor or simply open some older one and click with a right mouse button on the <a href="#sec2">Object tree view</a>. From the shown popup menu choose <strong>Add new item</strong> and now a New item should appear in the tree view. Right click on it and choose <strong>Rename</strong> to rename this item to be more familiar (Tree in snow for example).</p>
<p>Well, you have a new game object which can be placed into map, but it has no visual nor physical representation in the game itself. You have to associate a model to it first. You did a lot of work to create a model definition so it's now the time to use it. Right click on the new item again and choose <strong>Properties</strong>. A <a href="#sec3.1.2">file edit dialog</a> should appear with the lower panel empty. Your job is to fill the lower panel with adequate object properties. You can set its name, associate an icon to this object (if you have one) which will appear in the Map view when placed into map. Of course, the most important is associating a model to your new object, so doubleclick on the <strong>[Object] - whole set</strong> item in the right panel and you will be asked to choose the model definition file. Choose the one you've just created (say tree_snow.modelDef) and the lower panel will be automatically filled with a bunch of unset properties and one (Model) set to the chosen model definition file name. Always remember to watch the upper panel which contains complete description of all available properties so you can configure your new object properly. Setting all (needed) properties can take you a while, but the time spent here is well paid by the result you will see in the game.</p>
<p>Now it's time to place the object into your map, save it and take a ride! Once you are familiar with this procedure, stop limiting yourself with common objects, you can create anything you want! And remember that we are looking forward for seeing your products, just let us know that you have something by e-mail: <a href="mailto:works@crazyanimals.net">works@crazyanimals.net</a> or share your results and experiences with other player on our forums: <a href="http://forum.crazyanimals.net">forum.crazyanimals.net</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the Crazy Animals team wish you a <strong>lot of fun</strong> with the (hardly) Limited Editor and Unlimited Racer!</p>
