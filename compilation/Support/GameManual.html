	<a name="sec1.1"><h4>1.1 Warning about Epilepsy</h4></a>
	<p>
		Read this before you or your child use any video game.<br>
  Some people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when 
  viewing certain types of blinking lights or other stimuli commonly found in 
  our everyday environment. These persons are at risk of having a seizure when 
  they look at certain televised images or when they play video games. Such phenomena 
  can occur even in persons with no medical history of epilepsy and who have never 
  had an epileptic seizure. If you or a member of your family has ever shown symptoms 
  related to epilepsy (seizure or loss of consciousness) in the presence of illuminated 
  stimuli, consult your doctor before use. We advise parents to provide supervision 
  when chlidren play video games. Stop playing and consult a doctor immediately 
  if you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, vision 
  problems, eye or muscle spasms, loss of consciousness, disorientation, involuntary 
  movement or convulsion.<br>
  <br>
		Always take the following precautions when playing video games:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Do not sit or stand too close to the screen.
			</li>
			<li>
				Preferably, use video games on a small screen.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not play if you are tired or have not had enough sleep.
			</li>
			<li>
				Play in a well-lit area.
			</li>
			<li>
				While playing, take ten- to fifteeen-  minute breaks every hour.
			</li>
		</ul>

			5. Playing Unlimited Racer
		</h3>
	</a>
		
<h4><a name="sec5.1">5.1 Understanding your interface</a></h4>
<p><img src="images/Game_Interface.png" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Game interface looks like on the picture above. There is game race view and 
  HUD (Head-up display) consisting of four information parts. In the bottom right 
  corner is speedometer showing the speed of the car. In the bottom left corner 
  is the gear information, which shows the gear car has actually shifted. In the 
  upper left corner is race state information table, which informs you of the 
  position in the race. In the upper right corner appears music information for 
  a while when new music track starts playing. You can show game menu by pressing 
  ESC key any time.</p>
		<p>
		</p>
		
<h4><a name="sec5.2">5.2 Goal of Unlimited Racer</a></h4>
<p>The goal of Unlimited racer is to be first, to win the race, when you are playing 
  on lap race mode. If you are not playing on lap race mode, it's just race for 
  fun and you can do whatever you can and want.</p>
		<p>
		</p>

	<a name="sec6">
		<h3>6. General troubleshooting</h3>
	</a>
		
<h4><a name="sec6.1">6.1 Playing on video card with 64 MB of memory</a></h4>
<p>If you have video card with 64 MB of video RAM, then it's strongly recommended 
  to turn off antialiasing. Also you can open options.cfg configuration file in any text editor (Notepad for example) and replace following lines:<br>
  <br>LOD0TerrainTexWidth = 2048<br>
  LOD0TerrainTexHeight = 2048</p>
<p>for:<br><br>
  LOD0TerrainTexWidth = 1024<br>
  LOD0TerrainTexHeight = 1024</p>
<p>This will save a considerable amount of video memory and thus allows you in most cases to play game fine. (Note that you can decrease mentioned numbers even more, but the appearance of Unlimited Racer will decrease as well.)</p>

<h4><a name="sec6.2">6.2 Textures are shimmering or jiggling</a></h4>
		<p>If you have a Radeon video card you should download latest drivers. See <a href="#sec6.3">General lockups / Video problems</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="sec6.3">6.3 General lockups / Video problems</a></h4>
		<p>If your computer hard locks without error message, reboots during game play, will not start, or has distorted graphics of any sort, please make sure you have the latest video card drivers for your 3D accelerator. Contact your hardware manufacturer to find the latest drivers available.</p>

<h4><a name="sec6.4">6.4 Sound Issues</a></h4>
	<p> If you are experiencing sound distortions, periodic loss of sound, loud squelches, whistles, or pops, confirm that you have the latest version of DirectX installed on your system. Also, verify that your sound drivers are compatible with the newest version of DirectX. Contact your hardware manufacturer to find latest drivers available. </p>

<h4><a name="sec6.5">6.5 (Any) Other issues</a></h4>
	<p>If the game is not running as expected, you should always check the ErrorOutput.log file possible error report.</p>
	<p>With any problem you can seek our forums for a solution: <a href="http://forum.crazyanimals.net">http://forum.crazyanimals.net</a> or you can contant our support by e-mail: <a href="mailto:support@crazyanimals.net">support@crazyanimals.net</a>.</p>
