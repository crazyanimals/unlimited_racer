# UNLIMITED RACER

Unlimited Racer is a car racing game. The main features are:

Tracks with a variety of hurdles you have to (or may want to) manage in a chosen car.
Easy-to-use track editor that allows you to create as crazy tracks as you want. The only limit is your imagination.
Maximal adjustability of every item in the game. Simple syntax of configuration files gives you the possibility of extending the game by custom models, textures, car properties etc.
Multiplayer mode allowing you to share the fun with your friends on local network and Internet.
This game is being developed as an open source school project. That's why the development takes more time than you could probably expect and this is also the reason why it can not provide you with stunning graphic and music which we can not afford. Main technological features follows:
Our own optimized 3D graphic engine which however does not support older graphic cards (without Shader Model 2).
Integrated physical engine Newton Game Dynamics.
Highly configurable game engine which covers physics, graphics, GUI, AI module for single game mode and much more.

### A bit of history

We started to talk about this project in September 2003. 
It was the beginning of our third year on university and the time came to begin with team project. 
As roommates and neighbours we decided to work on this together, the question was only what are we going to do actually. 
There were a lot of ideas, but none of them acceptable for all of us. Finally this great idea came (or was it the worst idea ever?) and it all begun (October 2nd 2003).
